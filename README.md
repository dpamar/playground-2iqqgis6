# BrainFuck part 7 - Quine (+ some non-BF quine theory)

The goal of this playground is to create a _quine_ in BF

At the end of this playground, you should be able to
* understand what a quine is
* prove that a quine exists for any Turing-complete language (including BF)
* create a quine skeleton in BF
* generate the data for the quine using BF
* write a BF quine
* understand what a 2-step-quine is, and prove its existence
* write a BF 2-step-quine

Have fun !
